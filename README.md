# Lazy Loading

A simple implemenation of lazy loading images in JavaScript.

## About

The project at the end of Chris Ferndinandi's [DOM Injection and Traversal](https://vanillajsguides.com/dom-injection-and-traversal/) was to implement lazy loading of images. This is my attempt after reading that short guide. It doesn't follow his example to the letter, it was more the overall concept that I was trying to get right.

## TODO

1. Try another method of loading images besides injecting `<img>` tags, maybe have them already in place and then just set the src attribute?

## Demo
